Program made for those who want to learn how to construct chords and chord progressions. Made as a project for objective programing course at University of Wroclaw.

Written in C++ with SFML 2.4 library.

**It is still work in progress and it's not very functional in any way. Please let me know if there are any bugs/mistakes.**

## Compilation

SFML library is required to compile. On Ubuntu you can get it by:
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
To compile simply type:
```
make
```
Run with:
```
./cpa
```

## Diagram UML
Makes this code little easier to follow. (although it's not very accurate)
